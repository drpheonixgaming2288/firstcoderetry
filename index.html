        <p>JackSucksAtLife is my favorite YouTube celeb! He is a northern-english YouTuber with a folowing of about 1.12 mil! He has a second channel called "JackSucksAtStuff" where he does mostly Minecraft trolling on his server "SkyCade". He also has a third channel where he does videos about his Tesla model 3. This channel is called "Jack Massey Welsh". He is a very quirky and awkward guy. He is still very funny though. He uploads every other day. He always makes me laugh no matter what channel. That is why my favorite celebrity is Jack!</p>
